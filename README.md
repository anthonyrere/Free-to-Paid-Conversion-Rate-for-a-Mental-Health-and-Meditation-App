## Insights Deep-Dive

### Free to Premium Conversion Rate

- **11% of users** who engage with the app’s free features (e.g., basic meditations or mood trackers) choose to upgrade to a paid subscription.

The free-to-paid conversion rate for the app stands at 11%, meaning roughly 11 out of every 100 users transition from free features to purchasing a premium subscription. While this rate might seem modest, several factors contribute to it. Many users download the app out of curiosity or for short-term relief from stress or sleep issues, but not all commit to a long-term mental wellness routine. Without clear guidance, some users struggle to engage deeply with features like guided meditations or sleep routines, reducing their likelihood of subscribing.

To address this, the app introduced a personalized wellness roadmap in 2023, tailoring the experience to specific mental health goals like reducing anxiety or improving sleep, thereby fostering deeper connections and increasing conversions. However, barriers like busy schedules, inconsistent routines, or personal mental states also hinder engagement. Some users may delay subscription until prompted by promotions or challenges, highlighting the need for strategies to better address engagement and align with user goals.

### **Average Duration Between Registration and First-Time Meditation**

- On average, it takes users **3 to 4 days** to engage with their first meditation or mental health tool after registering.
- Ideally, users should engage on the same day they register to build momentum and establish a mindfulness routine.
- While the average provides useful insights, it is important to analyze the data more comprehensively by looking at additional metrics: median and mode.

### **Statistical Metrics**

1. **Mode: 0 Days**
2. **Median: 0 Days**
3. **Mean: 3.42 Days (Also the Average)**

### **Behavioral Insights**

- **Immediate Engagers (Mode = 0)**: Most users start meditating on the same day they register, indicating they are highly motivated or curious about the app’s features.
- **Delayed Engagers (Mean = 3.42)**: Some users take days or weeks to start. These users may need more reminders or guidance to begin their mindfulness journey.

### **Statistical Metrics**

1. **Mode: 0 Days**
2. **Median: 1 Day**
3. **Mean: 26 Days**

### **Behavioral Insights**
